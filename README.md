Learning to use GitHub

My name is Cait and I'm from Cape Town, South Africa.

I'm a musician - my instruments are electric guitar and vocals - and although I love numerous styles and genres of music, I have a lifelong passion for rock 'n' roll.

I am trying to learn front-end web development. I am very excited to be on this journey.
